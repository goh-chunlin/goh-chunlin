👋 **Polyglot Systems Architect** (Python/Go/C#). .NET Foundation Member. Currently architecting **SilverAI** (Deterministic Safety for IoT & Agentic Systems). Based in Singapore.

🎤 **Community Leadership:** Since 2019, I have served as a member and speaker for the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/community/speakers/goh-chun-lin), advocating for open-source development in the enterprise space.

🚀 **Open Source:** I created [go-onedrive](https://github.com/goh-chunlin/go-onedrive), a high-performance OneDrive SDK for Go (Golang). It has been adopted globally with [contributors from across the industry](https://github.com/goh-chunlin/go-onedrive/graphs/contributors), solving critical integration gaps for Go developers.

☁️ **Cloud Architecture:** I authored the [Orchard Core Basics Companion (OCBC)](https://gcl.gitbook.io/orchard-core-basics-companion-ocbc), the definitive guide for deploying .NET CMS architectures to **AWS** (ECS, Fargate, Aurora). It was [honourably mentioned by Lombiq](https://orcharddojo.net/blog/permission-based-menu-visibility-orchard-core-basics-companion-this-week-in-orchard-31-01-2025) for its depth on cloud-native patterns.

🎮 **Offline:** When I am not coding, I am usually commanding armies in [Command & Conquer](https://www.ea.com/games/command-and-conquer), or exploring narratives in [Honkai: Star Rail](https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/). I am also an avid anime enthusiast and occasional artist.
