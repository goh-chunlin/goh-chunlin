ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Chun Lin, a software developer from [a small village in Malaysia](https://goo.gl/maps/s2ymn2tsZ26bJgMV6), currently based in [Singapore](https://goo.gl/maps/LcMv21JdsCcnkCCr7?coh=178573&entry=tt). I specialise in building cloud-first web applications and APIs, and I work as a Senior Consultant at [Samsung SDS Asia Pacific](https://www.samsungsds.com/en/index.html).

ðŸŽ¤ In 2019, I became a proud member of the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/community/speakers/goh-chun-lin) family. I am currently also a speaker in the community.

ðŸš€ I'm the creator of [go-onedrive](https://github.com/goh-chunlin/go-onedrive), an open-source OneDrive library written in Go (Golang). It has gained popularity worldwide and garnered [contributors from the industries](https://github.com/goh-chunlin/go-onedrive/graphs/contributors). I continue to work on it as a side project, finding it not only a valuable learning tool for myself but also benefiting many others.

ðŸŽ® When I'm not coding, you'll find me working on personal hobby projects, diving into games like [Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/command-and-conquer/command-and-conquer-3-tiberium-wars), [Honkai Impact 3rd](https://honkaiimpact3.mihoyo.com/global/en-us/home), and [Honkai: Star Rail](https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/). I'm also an avid anime watcher, visual novel reader, and enjoy drawing anime characters as a creative outlet.

ðŸŒŸ Passionate about technology and constantly exploring new possibilities. Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects together!
